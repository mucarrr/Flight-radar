# Flight Radar 
In this great project, I present users to track live positions and routes of planes flying over Southern Europe. Also I list the flight details in List Page, such as tail code, latitude, longitude and heading. With 'setInterval feature of JS' I worked with real time data.

# 🔍Technologies Used:

🌐 RapidAPI: Used to fetch live flight details, including tail code, flight direction, altitude, and speed.

🛠️ Redux Toolkit: Ensured efficient and structured state management throughout the project.

💅 Tailwind CSS: Designed a clean, modern, and responsive user interface.

🗺️ Map and Route Visualization: Integrated map tools to display live flight routes interactively.

# 🚀 What I Learned From This Project:

✔️ Tackling performance and optimization challenges that come with real-time data streaming.

✔️Efficiently managing API limits and implementing rate limiting solutions.

✔️Integrating map-based visualization tools to display data in an intuitive and user-friendly way.

✔️Ensuring seamless coordination between backend data fetching and frontend user experiences.
